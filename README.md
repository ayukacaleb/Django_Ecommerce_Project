# Django_Ecommerce_Project
This project aims to develop a full-stack e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, add them to cart, make purchases, and manage their orders. The website will include features such as user authentication, product categorization, search functionality, payment integration, and order tracking to provide a seamless shopping experience.
